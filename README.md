## How It's Made
Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript

My main focus for this project was to get familiar with APIs, in particular [this](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php) cocktail API. 

## Optimizations
Adding more features that the cocktail API provides, like searching by ingredient and searching up a random cocktail recipe.
